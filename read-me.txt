This is my final practical project for skill demonstration in HTML/CSS.

For uploading icons the personal Font Awesome script code was used (provided by Font Awesome) in the head of the project.
If there is problem with uploading icons please enter your personal script code (lines 15-18) provided by Font Awesome.
